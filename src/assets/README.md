# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the application.

## Default Avatar

For this application, we would typically include a default avatar image (`default-avatar.png`) that would be used when a user doesn't have a profile picture.

In a production application, you would need to add:
- Default avatar image
- Application logo
- Favicon
- Other static images used throughout the application
